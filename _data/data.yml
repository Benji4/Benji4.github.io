career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Understanding what truly creates value and what my client therefore needs is my first priority.
      It makes me happy when I can observe how a fleshed-out and well-conceived solution is brought to life and makes a difference.
      I have implemented data-wrangling jobs on Foundry, Machine Learning models in plain scipy, and interactive dashboards for sales representatives in PowerBI.
      I enjoy working both on the nitty-gritty of PoCs, as well as the complexities of full platforms governing the entire life cycles of datasets.
      It’s always a team effort, which is why in the future, I would like to take more responsibility in a leadership role.
